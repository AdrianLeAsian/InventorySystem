# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Initializing the `.memory-bank` directory and its core documentation files.

## Recent Changes
- Created `.memory-bank/projectbrief.md`
- Created `.memory-bank/productContext.md`

## Next Steps
- Create `.memory-bank/systemPatterns.md`
- Create `.memory-bank/techContext.md`
- Create `.memory-bank/progress.md`
- Confirm all core memory bank files are initialized.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensuring all required memory bank files are present and contain initial, relevant information.
- The system is a PHP-based web application with a MySQL database.
