# Progress

## What Works
- Initial directory structure is in place.
- Core memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been initialized.
- The project appears to be a functional PHP-based inventory system based on the file structure.

## What's Left to Build
- The database (`db.sql`) needs to be imported into a MySQL server.
- The `config/db.php` file needs to be configured with correct database credentials.
- Full testing of all features (item management, category management, stock logging, reports, barcode scanning) is required.
- Potential improvements in UI/UX, error handling, and security.

## Current Status
The `.memory-bank` initialization is almost complete. The foundational documentation is in place.

## Known Issues
- None identified during the initialization phase.
- Standard setup issues related to XAMPP/MySQL configuration might arise during initial deployment or testing.
