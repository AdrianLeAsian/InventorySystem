- Manage categories and locations independently.
- Update stock levels for both non-perishable and perishable items.
- View a main inventory list with item status (No Stock, Low Stock, OK, Full).
- View a separate table for perishable items, ordered by expiry date (FIFO), with status indicators (Expired, Near, Fresh).
- Generate reports on inventory data.
- View a log of all recent inventory activities on the dashboard, including item name, category, action performed, date/time, and expiry status.

**User experience goals:**
