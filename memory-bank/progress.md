# Progress

This document tracks what works, what's left to build, the current status, and known issues for the InventorySystem project.

## What Works:
- The basic file structure for the InventorySystem project is in place.
- Core memory bank documentation has been initialized and is being maintained.
- Required field indicators have been successfully added to item and category modals.
- Reports page GUI has been refined with separate filters for daily reports and usage trends.
- Flatpickr calendar has been integrated for daily report date selection.
- A new blank page for messaging (`pages/messaging.php`) has been created.
- The sidebar (`includes/sidebar.php`) has been updated to include a navigation link to the messaging page.
- The messaging page (`pages/messaging.php`) has been cleared of its previous content.
- The reports page has been remade to focus on usage trends with an integrated period selection dropdown.
- Import items functionality via CSV has been implemented and is working correctly.
- Mock data (`mock_data.sql`) has been created and confirmed to be in the database.
- The "Import and Export Data" section has been added to the reports page, including the "Import Items" and "Export All Reports (CSV)" buttons.

## What's Left to Build:
- Full implementation of all features outlined in `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`.
- Re-evaluation of messaging page functionality based on user requirements.
- Comprehensive error handling and input validation.
- Security enhancements (e.g., prepared statements for all database operations).
- Detailed reporting functionalities (further enhancements).
- Consistency in marking required fields across all forms.
- **Critical Issue Resolution**: The "Export All Reports (CSV)" functionality needs to be fixed to correctly export data.

## Current Status:
- The project is in its early stages of development/maintenance.
- The environment is set up (XAMPP, Apache, PHP, MySQL).
- Initial project context has been documented and is being updated.
- UI/UX improvements are being implemented, specifically on the reports page.
- Import functionality is working.
- Export functionality is currently blocked by a data retrieval issue.

## Known Issues:
- Potential for SQL injection vulnerabilities if prepared statements are not consistently used.
- Undefined array key warnings or unknown column errors if database schema changes are not synchronized with code.
- **"Export All Reports (CSV)" is producing blank files**: Despite data existing in the database, the PHP script is not successfully fetching data for the combined CSV export. This is the primary blocking issue.
