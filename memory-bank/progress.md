# Progress

**Status:** Edit button color updated.

**Completed:**
- Implemented the feature to track the date and time an item was inputted into the system by adding an `input_timestamp` column to the `items` table in `db_inventory.sql`.
- Updated the dashboard page to remove the old summary cards and implement new ones with counters for total items, near/expired items, and low stock alerts, including colored indicators (green, orange, red) based on item details.
- Applied styling to the summary cards in `assets/css/style.css` to match the provided image.
- Housed the summary cards within a `dashboard-container` for better organization and styling.
- Updated the color of the edit button in the inventory page to the green palette.

**Remaining:**
- Continue with any other pending tasks or user requests.
