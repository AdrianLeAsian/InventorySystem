# Progress

This document tracks what works, what's left to build, the current status, and known issues for the InventorySystem project.

## What Works:
- The basic file structure for the InventorySystem project is in place.
- Core memory bank documentation has been initialized.

## What's Left to Build:
- Full implementation of all features outlined in `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`.
- Comprehensive error handling and input validation.
- Security enhancements (e.g., prepared statements for all database operations).
- Detailed reporting functionalities.

## Current Status:
- The project is in its early stages of development/maintenance.
- The environment is set up (XAMPP, Apache, PHP, MySQL).
- Initial project context has been documented.

## Known Issues:
- The current task started with Apache logs showing errors related to a *different* project (`RentManangementSystem`), not `InventorySystem`. This needs to be clarified with the user.
- Potential for SQL injection vulnerabilities if prepared statements are not consistently used.
- Undefined array key warnings or unknown column errors if database schema changes are not synchronized with code.
