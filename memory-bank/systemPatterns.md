# System Patterns

## System Architecture
The Inventory Management System follows a traditional web application architecture. It appears to be primarily server-side rendered using PHP.

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript for user interface elements.
- **Backend:** PHP for handling business logic, database interactions, and rendering dynamic content.
- **Database:** MySQL, as indicated by the presence of `.sql` files (`db_inventory.sql`, `db_inventory_mock_data.sql`).
- **Structure:** A common pattern of including header, sidebar, and action files (`includes/header.php`, `includes/sidebar.php`, `includes/category_location_actions.php`, etc.) suggests a modular approach within a procedural PHP framework.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **Technology Stack:** PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS.
- **Database Interaction:** Likely uses direct MySQL queries or a simple abstraction layer within `includes/db.php`.
- **Modularity:** Code is organized into include files for reusability (e.g., headers, footers, action handlers).
- **Data Mocking:** `db_inventory_mock_data.sql` suggests a practice of using mock data for development or testing.
