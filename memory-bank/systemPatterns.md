# System Patterns

The Inventory System appears to follow a common web application structure, likely using PHP for the backend given the file extensions and common web development practices.

**Observed Patterns:**
- **MVC-like structure (potential):** Files like `inventory.php`, `login.php`, `reports.php` suggest distinct modules or controllers. The presence of `includes/` directory with files like `auth.php`, `db.php`, `header.php`, `sidebar.php` indicates a separation of concerns for common functionalities (authentication, database connection, UI components).
- **Database Interaction:** `db_inventory.sql` suggests a database schema is provided or used. `includes/db.php` likely handles database connections.
- **Frontend Components:** `assets/css/style.css` and `assets/images/logo.png` indicate frontend assets are managed separately.
- **Authentication Flow:** `login.php`, `logout.php`, `signup.php`, and `includes/auth.php` point to a standard user authentication system.

**Key Technical Decisions (Inferred):**
- PHP as the primary backend language.
- Likely a relational database (e.g., MySQL, given `db_inventory.sql`).
- Separation of concerns for backend logic and frontend presentation.
