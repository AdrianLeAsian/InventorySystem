# Technical Context

This document details the technologies used, development setup, technical constraints, and dependencies for the InventorySystem project.

## Technologies Used:
- **Backend:** PHP (version 8.x recommended, based on Apache logs)
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Web Server:** Apache HTTP Server
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (likely vanilla JS or minimal libraries)
- **Database Management:** phpMyAdmin (commonly used with XAMPP)

## Development Setup:
- **Local Server Environment:** XAMPP (Apache, MySQL, PHP, Perl) is used, as indicated by the file paths in the error logs (`C:\\xampp\\htdocs`).
- **Project Root:** `c:/xampp/htdocs/InventorySystem`

## Technical Constraints:
- **PHP Version Compatibility:** Ensure code is compatible with the PHP version running on the XAMPP server.
- **MySQL Version Compatibility:** Ensure SQL queries are compatible with the MySQL version.
- **Security:** Basic security practices should be followed, especially concerning database interactions (e.g., prepared statements to prevent SQL injection, though current implementation might not fully utilize them).

## Dependencies:
- **PHP Extensions:** Standard PHP extensions required for MySQL connectivity (e.g., `mysqli` or `pdo_mysql`).
- **Apache Modules:** Standard Apache modules for PHP processing (e.g., `mod_php`).
- **No major frontend frameworks:** Based on the file structure, it's unlikely that frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js are used.
