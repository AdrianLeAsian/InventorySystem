# Tech Context

## Technologies Used

- **Server-Side Language:** PHP
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (assumed)
- **Web Server:** Apache (implied by `c:/xampp/htdocs/`)

## Development Setup

The project is set up within a XAMPP environment, indicated by the `c:/xampp/htdocs/` directory. This suggests a local development environment with Apache, MySQL, and PHP pre-configured.

## Dependencies

- **PHP Extensions:** Likely requires MySQLi or PDO for database interaction.
- **External Libraries:** No explicit mention of external JavaScript or PHP libraries, but they might be present and not immediately obvious from the file list.

## Technical Constraints

- **Legacy Codebase:** The project structure and file names suggest a potentially older codebase, which might have implications for modern development practices or security.
- **PHP Version:** The specific PHP version is not specified, which could affect compatibility with newer libraries or language features.
