# Active Context

**Current work focus:**
Implemented automatic creation of new categories and locations during CSV import if they do not exist, and provided guidance on data quality issues in the CSV.

**Recent changes:**
- Modified `import_csv.php` to include counters for `imported_count` and `skipped_count`.
- Added an `errors` array to `import_csv.php` to log specific reasons for skipped rows (e.g., insufficient columns, missing category/location, database insertion errors).
- The JSON response from `import_csv.php` now includes a summary message with counts and a list of errors if any rows were skipped or failed to insert.
- The JavaScript in `inventory.php`'s `showImportCsvModal()` now attempts to parse the JSON response and display the detailed message.
- **FIXED:** `import_csv.php` now handles unauthenticated access by returning a JSON error instead of redirecting, ensuring proper AJAX response handling.
- **NEW:** `import_csv.php` now performs an UPSERT operation for items:
    - If an item with the same name exists, it updates the item's details in the `items` table.
    - If an item with the same name does not exist, it inserts a new item into the `items` table.
    - For perishable items, existing batches are deleted and a new batch is inserted into `item_batches` with the imported stock and expiry date.
- Added `trim()` to CSV data parsing and basic `expiry_date` format validation in `import_csv.php`.
- **FIXED:** Removed a syntax error (unexpected `</content>` tag) from `import_csv.php` on line 166.
- **IMPROVED:** Enabled `MYSQLI_REPORT_ERROR | MYSQLI_REPORT_STRICT` in `includes/db.php` for more robust database error reporting.
- **IMPROVED:** Added extensive `error_log` statements to `import_csv.php` for better debugging of the import process.
- **NEW:** `import_csv.php` now automatically creates new categories and locations if they are not found in the database during the import process.

**Next steps:**
- Verify the import functionality with the user and address any further feedback.

**Active decisions and considerations:**
- Consistent use of prepared statements significantly reduces SQL injection risks.
- Session-based authentication ensures that only logged-in users can access sensitive application pages.
- The database connection using `root` with no password remains a security concern for production environments and has been noted in `techContext.md`.
- The import CSV process now provides a better user experience through a modal, including a template download option that provides a blank CSV with headers, and improved feedback after import, including details on imported/skipped rows and specific errors.
