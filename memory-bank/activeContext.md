# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Initializing the `.memory-bank` directory and its core documentation files.

## Recent Changes
- Initialized all core memory bank files: `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, and `progress.md`.

## Next Steps
- Continue with the main task, leveraging the established memory bank for context.
- Ensure `progress.md` accurately reflects the current state of the project.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Ensuring all required memory bank files are present and contain initial, relevant information.
- The system is a PHP-based web application with a MySQL database.
