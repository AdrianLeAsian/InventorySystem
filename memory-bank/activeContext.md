# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions/considerations for the InventorySystem project.

## Current Work Focus:
- Initial project setup and memory bank documentation.
- Addressing any immediate issues or user requests related to the InventorySystem.

## Recent Changes:
- Creation of core memory bank documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`).

## Next Steps:
- Create `progress.md`.
- Analyze the user's initial request (Apache logs) and determine if any action is required for the `InventorySystem` project.
- If the Apache logs are not related to `InventorySystem`, inform the user and ask for clarification on the task.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- The provided Apache logs indicate errors from `RentManangementSystem`, not `InventorySystem`. This needs to be clarified with the user.
- Ensure all core memory bank files are created and populated before proceeding with specific tasks.
