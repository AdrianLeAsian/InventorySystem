# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions/considerations for the InventorySystem project.

## Current Work Focus:
- Remaking the reports page to focus on usage trends.
- Removing import and export data functionalities from the system.
- Maintaining and updating memory bank documentation.
- Cleared the messaging page as per user request.

## Recent Changes:
- **Removed Import/Export Features**:
    - Deleted `export.php`, `ajax/import_items.php`, `ajax/export_all_reports.php`, `includes/import_items_modal.php`, `assets/templates/sample_inventory_import.csv`, `assets/templates/sample_inventory_template.csv`.
    - Removed "Import and Export Data" section from `pages/reports.php`.
    - Removed "Import" button and related JavaScript logic from `pages/inventory.php` and `js/inventory.js`.
- **Inventory Page (`pages/inventory.php`)**: Removed "Low Stock Threshold", "Min Stock", "Max Stock", and "Last Activity" columns from the "All Inventory Items" tab for visual declutter. These fields remain editable in item modals and are still present in backend logic for feature dependencies.
- **Reports Page (`pages/reports.php`)**:
    - Streamlined to focus solely on "Usage Trends Report".
    - Period selection (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly) is now a dropdown integrated into the card header for a cleaner UI.
- **Mock Data (`mock_data.sql`)**: A new SQL file was created to provide sample data for testing all system features, especially the reports and import/export. (Note: This file is still present but its primary purpose for import/export testing is now obsolete).
- **Messaging Page (`pages/messaging.php`)**: The content of this page has been cleared, removing the SMS recipient management and low stock SMS sending functionalities.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Ensure consistency in marking required fields across all forms in the application.
- The previous task regarding Apache logs for `RentManangementSystem` was a misunderstanding; the current focus is on `InventorySystem` UI improvements.
- Re-evaluation of the messaging page's purpose and future functionality is needed.
- All import/export related files and code references have been removed.
