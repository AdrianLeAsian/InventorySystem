# Active Context

**Current work focus:**
Implemented a role-based access control system and enhanced user management features.

**Recent changes:**
-   **Role System Implementation**:
    -   Modified `login.php` to fetch and store the user's role in the session (`$_SESSION['user_role']`) upon successful login.
    -   Added role checks to `inventory.php` and `users.php` to restrict access to 'admin' role users only.
    -   Updated `users.php` to include functionality for admins to add new users with specified roles and to manage existing users' roles. The GUI of the User Management page was also updated for consistency with the system.
    -   Modified `includes/sidebar.php` to conditionally display the 'Users' link only for users with the 'admin' role.
-   **Previous Work (Prepared Statements & Authentication)**:
    -   Implemented prepared statements for all database queries to prevent SQL injection.
    -   Added session-based authentication checks to key pages (`dashboard.php`, `inventory.php`, `reports.php`, `users.php`) via `includes/auth.php`.

**Next steps:**
-   Address any further feedback or new requirements from the user.

**Active decisions and considerations:**
-   Role-based access control enhances security by limiting access to sensitive features based on user privileges.
-   Centralizing role checks in pages and the sidebar ensures consistent enforcement of access policies.
-   The user management interface in `users.php` now provides admins with the necessary tools to manage user accounts and their roles.
-   The security concern regarding the database connection (`root` user with no password) noted in `techContext.md` remains for production environments.
