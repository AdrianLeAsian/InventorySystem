# Active Context

**Current work focus:**
Implemented prepared statements for all database queries and added session-based authentication checks to `dashboard.php`, `inventory.php`, `reports.php`, and `users.php` to prevent unauthorized access.

**Recent changes:**
- Modified `inventory.php` to use prepared statements for category, location, and perishable item fetching.
- Modified `includes/item_actions.php` to use prepared statements for updating `items` table.
- Modified `includes/stock_actions.php` to use prepared statements for updating `items` table.
- Added `include 'includes/auth.php';` to `dashboard.php`, `inventory.php`, `reports.php`, and `users.php` to enforce session-based authentication.
- Updated `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` to reflect these security and authentication changes.

**Next steps:**
- Address any further feedback or new requirements from the user.

**Active decisions and considerations:**
- Consistent use of prepared statements significantly reduces SQL injection risks.
- Session-based authentication ensures that only logged-in users can access sensitive application pages.
- The database connection using `root` with no password remains a security concern for production environments and has been noted in `techContext.md`.
