This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions/considerations for the InventorySystem project.

## Current Work Focus:

- Maintaining and updating memory bank documentation.

## Recent Changes:
- Added red asterisk (*) indicators for required fields in `includes/add_item_modal.php` and `includes/add_category_modal.php`.
- Added CSS styling for `.required-indicator` in `css/main.css`.
- Refactored `pages/reports.php` GUI to separate daily report date filter and usage trends period selection into distinct cards.
- Added `ml-auto` utility class to `css/main.css`.
- Integrated Flatpickr calendar into `pages/reports.php` for daily report date selection.
- Created a new blank page for messaging at `pages/messaging.php`.
- Updated `includes/sidebar.php` to include a navigation link to the messaging page.
- Added basic HTML structure and placeholder content to `pages/messaging.php`.
- Reviewed and updated memory bank documentation.

## Next Steps:
- The new messaging page has been created with basic content and is accessible via the sidebar.
- Continue with further UI/UX enhancements or other user-requested features.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
