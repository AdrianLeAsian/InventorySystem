# Active Context

## Current Work
Initializing the memory bank for the Inventory Management System project. This involves creating the core documentation files to establish project context and guidelines.

## Recent Changes
- Created `projectbrief.md` to define the project's scope.
- Created `productContext.md` to outline the product's purpose, problems solved, functionality, and user experience goals.

## Next Steps
- Create `systemPatterns.md` to document the system architecture and key technical decisions.
- Create `techContext.md` to detail the technologies used and development setup.
- Create `progress.md` to track the project's progress and known issues.
