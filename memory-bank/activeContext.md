**Recent changes:**
- Re-implemented dashboard summary cards with counters, colored indicators, and housed them within a `dashboard-container`.
- Corrected SQL query for "Low Stock Alerts" to use `current_stock`.
- Adjusted logic for "Near/Expired Items" to prioritize red if any items are expired.
- Implemented color indicators using SVG circles for consistent rendering.
- Changed the background color of `.btn-warning` (used for edit buttons) to `var(--success)` and its hover state to `var(--primary-light)`.
- Changed the background color of `.btn-warning` (used for edit buttons) to `var(--success)` and its hover state to `var(--primary-light)`.

**Next steps:**
- Continue with any other pending tasks or user requests.

**Active decisions and considerations:**
- The `item_batches` table is crucial for tracking perishable items and their expiry dates.
- Initial stock for perishable items must be treated as a batch with an expiry date from the moment of item creation.
- The dashboard summary cards provide a quick overview of inventory status, with visual cues for urgent attention.
