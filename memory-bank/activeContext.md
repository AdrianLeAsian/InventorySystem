# Active Context

**Current work focus:**
Refactored the layout of the Categories and Locations tables on `inventory.php` to display side-by-side, and grouped the "Inventory Overview" heading with its summary cards on `dashboard.php` within a new container.

**Recent changes:**
- Modified `inventory.php` to use a flexbox container for the Categories and Locations tables, placing them in one row.
- Modified `dashboard.php` to wrap the `<h2>Inventory Overview</h2>` and the `dashboard-summary` div within a new `dashboard-section` div.
- Added new CSS rules to `assets/css/style.css` for the `.dashboard-section` to provide visual grouping and spacing.
- Updated `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` to reflect these UI/layout changes.

**Next steps:**
- Address any further feedback or new requirements from the user.

**Active decisions and considerations:**
- The use of flexbox for table layout improves responsiveness and visual organization on `inventory.php`.
- The `dashboard-section` container on `dashboard.php` enhances the visual hierarchy and readability of the dashboard overview.
- Maintaining consistent styling across the application is crucial for a good user experience.
