# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions/considerations for the InventorySystem project.

## Current Work Focus:
- Implementing UI/UX improvements based on user requests.
- Maintaining and updating memory bank documentation.

## Recent Changes:
 - Removed Low Stock Threshold, Min Stock, Max Stock, and Last Activity columns from the All Inventory Items tab in `pages/inventory.php` for visual declutter. These fields remain editable in item modals and are still present in backend logic for feature dependencies.

- Continue with further UI/UX enhancements or other user-requested features.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Ensure consistency in marking required fields across all forms in the application.
- The previous task regarding Apache logs for `RentManangementSystem` was a misunderstanding; the current focus is on `InventorySystem` UI improvements.
