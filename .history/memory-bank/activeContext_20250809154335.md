# Active Context

This document outlines the current work focus, recent changes, next steps, and active decisions/considerations for the InventorySystem project.

## Current Work Focus:
- Implementing UI/UX improvements based on user requests.
- Maintaining and updating memory bank documentation.
- Fixing the Filter Items Report feature.
- Improving the Usage Trends (Stock Out) chart.

## Recent Changes:
 - Removed Low Stock Threshold, Min Stock, Max Stock, and Last Activity columns from the All Inventory Items tab in `pages/inventory.php` for visual declutter. These fields remain editable in item modals and are still present in backend logic for feature dependencies.
 - Refined the backend logic for the Filter Items Report in `ajax/get_filtered_items.php` to correctly apply item status filters (In Stock, Low Stock, Out of Stock) and ensure proper parameter binding for SQL queries.
 - Implemented backend logic for dynamic usage trends filtering in `ajax/get_usage_trends.php` to support Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly, and Custom date ranges.
 - Updated `pages/reports.php` to include new filter controls for usage trends.
 - Updated `js/reports.js` to handle fetching and rendering usage trends data dynamically with Chart.js, including date formatting and X-axis label adjustments.
 - Fixed a Chart.js context error in `js/reports.js` by ensuring the canvas element is correctly re-created when no data is available or an error occurs.

## Next Steps:
- Continue with further UI/UX enhancements or other user-requested features.
- Verify the frontend behavior of the Filter Items Report and Usage Trends chart.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- Ensure consistency in marking required fields across all forms in the application.
- The previous task regarding Apache logs for `RentManangementSystem` was a misunderstanding; the current focus is on `InventorySystem` UI improvements.
