# Progress

This document tracks what works, what's left to build, the current status, and known issues for the InventorySystem project.

## What Works:
- The basic file structure for the InventorySystem project is in place.
- Core memory bank documentation has been initialized and is being maintained.
- Required field indicators have been successfully added to item and category modals.
- Reports page GUI has been refined with separate filters for daily reports and usage trends.
- Flatpickr calendar has been integrated for daily report date selection.
- A new blank page for messaging (`pages/messaging.php`) has been created.
- The sidebar (`includes/sidebar.php`) has been updated to include a navigation link to the messaging page.
- Basic HTML structure and placeholder content have been added to `pages/messaging.php`.
- The backend logic for the Filter Items Report in `ajax/get_filtered_items.php` has been refined to correctly apply item status filters and ensure proper parameter binding for SQL queries.
- The backend for Usage Trends (`ajax/get_usage_trends.php`) has been updated to fetch both 'in' and 'out' stock movements, supporting daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, and custom date range filtering.
- The frontend for Usage Trends (`pages/reports.php` and `js/reports.js`) has been updated to include a view type selector, conditional date pickers, and dynamic chart rendering that now displays both 'in' and 'out' quantities for items.
- The Chart.js context error in `js/reports.js` has been fixed by ensuring the canvas element is correctly re-created when no data is available or an error occurs.

## What's Left to Build:
- Full implementation of all features outlined in `projectbrief.md` and `productContext.md`.
- Full implementation of messaging functionality on the new page.
- Comprehensive error handling and input validation.
- Security enhancements (e.g., prepared statements for all database operations).
- Detailed reporting functionalities (further enhancements).
- Consistency in marking required fields across all forms.
- Frontend verification of the Filter Items Report feature.

## Current Status:
- The project is in its early stages of development/maintenance.
- The environment is set up (XAMPP, Apache, PHP, MySQL).
- Initial project context has been documented and is being updated.
- UI/UX improvements are being implemented, specifically on the reports page.
- Backend fixes for the Filter Items Report are complete.
- Usage Trends chart functionality has been implemented for various time ranges, and the Chart.js context error has been resolved.

## Known Issues:
- Potential for SQL injection vulnerabilities if prepared statements are not consistently used.
- Undefined array key warnings or unknown column errors if database schema changes are not synchronized with code.
